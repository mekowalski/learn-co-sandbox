Components: modular, functional pieces that are reusable and present the code
-Help keep code organized and predictable, describing what should be rendered to DOM

Step 1: Write Components
  class Songs extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Winning Streak</h1>
          <h1>Lonely Summer</h1>
          <h1>Inner Love</h1>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  
  -New Class: Songs, is declared
  -Class extends React's Component class, providing built in methods/attributes
  -A render() method is defined, which returns what is explicitly provided, onto DOM
