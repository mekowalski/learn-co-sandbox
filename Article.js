// Step1: Write the Component

class Article extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        I am following along with the Learn Components lesson.  Not certain how sandbox works though.
      </div>
    )
  }
}

// new class Article is declared
// class extends React's Component class which provides built in methods/attributes
// render() is defined and returns explicitly what is state in render({ return() })
