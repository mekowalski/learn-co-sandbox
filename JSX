JSX: Not a string, it is the return value of th render() method
-Every component used, needs a render() methos to return valid JSX
-Entire return statement is wrapped in 1 parentheses()

***NOTE ON ARROW FUNCTIONS***
eg: aMethod = () => new Method().toString()

-Using an arrow function with its respective syntax IMPLICITLY BINDS the method to the class in which it's declared.
-If a function is called in a class OUTSIDE its origin class, without the arrow function syntax, the method will
 need to be EXPLICITLY BIND(ED) to the class it's originally from
 
 eg: this.aMethod().bind(this)
 
JSX: Cannot include all JavaScript Statements
-It is an extension of JavaScript, it is considered declarative
 
<<<<<<< HEAD
-A Component must return 1 JSX element
-Without an element wrapped in a returned JSX within a Component, there will be an error
  ***with some exceptions***
  
-Ultimately all JSX code gets compiled down to a standard JavaScript that will turn into original syntax
  eg: React.createElement
