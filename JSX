JSX: Not a string, it is the return value of th render() method
-Every component used, needs a render() methos to return valid JSX
-Entire return statement is wrapped in 1 parentheses()

***NOTE ON ARROW FUNCTIONS***
eg: aMethod = () => new Method().toString()

-Using an arrow function with its respective syntax IMPLICITLY BINDS the method to the class in which it's declared.
-If a function is called in a class OUTSIDE its origin class, without the arrow function syntax, the method will
 need to be EXPLICITLY BIND(ED) to the class it's originally from
 
 eg: this.aMethod().bind(this)
